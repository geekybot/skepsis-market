# Skepsis: Decentralized Continuous Outcome Prediction Markets

Skepsis is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Sui blockchain that enables trading on continuous numerical outcome spaces rather than just binary outcomes. This repository contains both the smart contract implementation (`skepsis_market`) and the web frontend (`skepsis-web`).

## Motivation

This project is inspired by the innovative concept of Distribution Markets presented in the [Paradigm paper](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/12/distribution-markets). While traditional prediction markets focus on binary outcomes, Skepsis implements continuous outcome spacesâ€”allowing traders to bet on precise numerical ranges rather than simple yes/no scenarios.

Skepsis represents my first adventure into the Sui ecosystem as part Sui Overflow Hackathon. As such, I want to transparently acknowledge that it may contain several security flaws and should be considered experimental software rather than production-ready code. This implementation serves primarily as a proof of concept.

Developing Skepsis has been an incredibly thrilling journey for me. Learning the Move language and building on Sui has opened up fascinating possibilities that weren't achievable in other blockchain environments I've worked with previously. The composability of assets in Sui and the flexibility of Move's resource model made implementing complex market mechanics significantly more intuitive than I expected. Despite the challenges of building a sophisticated financial protocol in a new ecosystem, the development process has reinforced my belief in the potential of continuous outcome prediction markets to provide more nuanced forecasting tools than traditional binary markets.

## Project Structure

- `skepsis_market/`: Move smart contracts implementing the prediction market protocol
- `skepsis-web/`: Next.js web application for interacting with the markets
- `usdc/`: USDC mock implementation for testnet

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/install) (version 1.0.0+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended) or npm

### Building and Publishing the Smart Contracts

1. Navigate to the `skepsis_market` directory:
   ```bash
   cd skepsis_market
   ```

2. Build the Move package:
   ```bash
   sui move build
   ```

3. Publish to testnet (make sure you have a wallet with SUI balance):
   ```bash
   sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
   ```

4. Note the package object ID from the output for later use.

### Running the Web Application

1. Navigate to the `skepsis-web` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../skepsis-web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
