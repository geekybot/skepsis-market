# Skepsis Documentation

Welcome to the Skepsis documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and use the Skepsis decentralized prediction market platform.

## Documentation Overview

Skepsis is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Sui blockchain that enables users to express nuanced beliefs about future events through continuous numerical outcomes. Unlike traditional prediction markets that only offer binary yes/no outcomes, Skepsis allows trading on distributions across a range of possible outcomes.
