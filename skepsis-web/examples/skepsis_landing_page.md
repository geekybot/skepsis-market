# Skepsis Market

**Markets for Collective Knowledge**  
A decentralized distribution prediction marketplace powered by Sui.

## üß≠ What is Skepsis?

**Skepsis** is an incentivized truth-seeking protocol.  
It transforms uncertainty into insight by letting users stake beliefs on real-world questions.

## üéØ The Problem

- Information is siloed, biased, and lacks aligned incentives.
- Traditional prediction platforms are closed, centralized, or non-composable.
- There is no scalable mechanism to price belief ‚Äî until now.

> ‚úçÔ∏è *Image: Fragmented opinions or disconnected data points with no resolution*

---

## üí° Our Solution

Skepsis introduces **continuous prediction markets** that resolve based on distribution proximity.

- Anyone can create a market.
- Participants allocate weight to expected outcomes.
- The market resolves and rewards closeness to truth.

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Create a Market**  
   Define a question, resolution window, and range of possible values.

2. **Stake Belief**  
   Users buy outcome buckets on a continuous curve (LMSR-style AMM).

3. **Truth Emerges**  
   Market prices reveal collective expectations. Resolution pays out proportionally.
