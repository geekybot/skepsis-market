# Skepsis Market Test Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the test suite for the Skepsis Market project. It covers the tests defined in the project, their purpose, implementation approach, and execution status.

## 1. Distribution Math Tests (`distribution_math_tests.move`)

### Purpose
The distribution math tests verify the mathematical functions that power the Skepsis Market, focusing on fixed-point math operations essential for market pricing and share calculations.

### Tests Overview

#### 1.1 `test_exp_simple`
- **Purpose**: Tests basic exponential function calculations
- **Approach**: Verifies that exp(0) = 1 and exp(1) ≈ 2.718281
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Uses precision bounds (0.1% margin of error) to account for fixed-point arithmetic approximations

#### 1.2 `test_exp_ranges`
- **Purpose**: Tests exponential function over different input magnitudes
- **Approach**: Tests small (0.1), medium (2.0), and large (20.0) inputs
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: The large input test is especially important to ensure no overflow occurs

#### 1.3 `test_ln_simple`
- **Purpose**: Tests natural logarithm calculations
- **Approach**: Verifies that ln(1) = 0 and ln(e) = 1
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Uses the exp function to generate the value of e for testing

#### 1.4 `test_ln_ranges`
- **Purpose**: Tests logarithm function over different input ranges
- **Approach**: Tests values < 1 (0.5) and > 1 (10.0)
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- **Notes**: The test for values < 1 is only used for debugging output, without assertions

#### 1.5 `test_calculate_cost`
- **Purpose**: Tests the LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) cost function
- **Approach**: Tests cost calculation with:
  - Equal quantities for 2 outcomes (1.0, 1.0)
  - Different quantities for 2 outcomes (2.0, 1.0)
  - Equal quantities for 3 outcomes (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: The cost function is a core part of market pricing

#### 1.6 `test_edge_cases`
- **Purpose**: Tests for potential edge cases and overflow protection
- **Approach**: 
  - Tests with small liquidity parameter (b = 1)
  - Tests with highly skewed quantities (10.0, 0.1)
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Important for ensuring market stability under extreme conditions

## 2. Excess Shares Tests (`excess_shares_test.move`)

### Purpose
Tests the market's validation mechanism that prevents purchasing more shares than available in the liquidity cap.

### Tests Overview

#### 2.1 `test_excessive_share_purchase_fails`
- **Purpose**: Verifies that the market rejects attempts to buy more shares than the total pool liquidity
- **Approach**: 
  - Creates a market with 1,000,000,000 tokens liquidity
  - Attempts to buy (total_shares + 1,000,000) shares
  - Expects failure with ERROR_SHARE_CAP_EXCEEDED
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Critical test for protecting market solvency

## 3. Distribution Market Tests (`distribution_market_tests.move`)

### Purpose
Tests the core functionality of the distribution market, including market creation, buying/selling shares, and liquidity provider rewards.

### Tests Overview

#### 3.1 `test_market_creation_and_liquidity`
- **Purpose**: Tests the initialization of a market and verification of market parameters
- **Approach**: 
  - Creates a market with 1,000,000,000 tokens liquidity
  - Verifies all market parameters (question, timestamps, bounds, etc.)
  - Verifies spreads creation (10 spreads, correctly configured)
  - Confirms liquidity share NFT creation for the market owner
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Tests the foundational setup of the market

#### 3.2 `test_buy_sell_shares`
- **Purpose**: Tests the complete trading cycle, including buying and selling shares
- **Approach**:
  - Creates a market with 1,000,000,000 tokens liquidity
  - Multiple traders buy shares in different spreads
  - Tests partial selling (half of position)
  - Tests complete selling of positions
  - Verifies final share balances across all spreads
- **Status**: ✅ PASS (After refactoring)
- **Notes**: Originally contained 40+ redundant transaction blocks that were refactored into helper functions

#### 3.3 `test_lp_rewards_and_edge_cases`
- **Purpose**: Tests liquidity provider rewards after market resolution
- **Approach**:
  - Creates a market and adds additional liquidity
  - Has a trader purchase 40% of available shares
  - Resolves the market in the trader's favor
  - Verifies the trader receives correct winnings
  - Confirms LP can withdraw remaining liquidity
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **Notes**: Validates the economic model for liquidity providers

## 4. Distribution Market Factory Tests (`distribution_market_factory_tests.move`)

### Purpose
Tests the factory pattern for creating distribution markets, which would simplify deployment in production.

### Tests Overview

#### 4.1 `test_initialize_factory_and_create_market`
- **Purpose**: Tests factory initialization and market creation via factory
- **Approach**:
  - Initializes a factory with an admin capability
  - Creates a market through the factory
- **Status**: ⚠️ COMMENTED OUT
- **Notes**: This test is currently commented out and not running

## Recommendations

1. **Complete the factory tests**: Uncomment and implement the distribution market factory tests to ensure the factory pattern works as expected.

2. **Improve the `test_ln_ranges` test**: Add proper assertions for the case where the input is less than 1 to ensure the logarithm function works correctly in all cases.

3. **Consider property-based testing**: For the mathematical functions, consider implementing property-based tests to verify mathematical properties like `exp(ln(x)) ≈ x` across a wide range of inputs.

4. **Add stress tests**: Test the market with many users simultaneously, large position sizes, and edge case prices to ensure market stability under load.

5. **Refactor repetitive test patterns**: The initial `test_buy_sell_shares` function was refactored to use helper functions, which significantly improved code maintainability. Similar patterns could be applied to other tests.
